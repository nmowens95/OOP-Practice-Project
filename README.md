Here is a small OOP practice Project.

The goal is to set up classes that handle Withdrawals, Deposits, and Transfers. To work with inheritance we use a savings account and interest rewards account to take on similar properties.


Another practicing feature is exception handling and raising exceptions when there may be an issue. 

For possible future additions:
-Can make the project actually interactive by prompting inputs
-Can add transactions, as well as a fee that may be applied
-Create a family share plan
